nRF52840dk Bootloader
=====================

This is an experimental version of the Tock bootloader over UART for the nrf52
series of chips. However, no actual boards ever used this version, since no
Tock-compatible boards ever used the nRF52 with an FTDI chip.

If you would like to use this, however, you can with an older version of the
bootloader:

```shell
$ git checkout v1.0.1
```
