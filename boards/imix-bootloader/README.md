The Imix Bootloader
===================

Bootloader for Imix written on top of Tock.

The bootloader for Imix is only implemented for an older version of the
bootloader. To reduce developer overhead, we decided to not port updates to this
platform, and instead stick with the old (but known to be working!) version.

To build the bootloader for Imix, please use version "v1.0.1" of the bootloader.

```shell
$ git checkout v1.0.1
```
